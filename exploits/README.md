## README

In this page, we show our exploits of vulnerabilities in our paper. Each of the exploits is organized as follow:

* Source code. Including attacker contract, internal contract and target contract)
* Attack flow. Attack flows can help readers understand the how the ethers are stolen.
* Screenshots. All of our exploits are implemented in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) platform. We provide running screenshots to evidence the reported vulnerabilities.

## Exploits List

#### Exploits of Examples in Paper:

In the following pages, we show our exploits of vulnerabilities of figure 4 and figure 13 in our paper:

* [Exploit of Figure 13](./exploits-of-example/exploits-of-figure13.md)

#### Exploits of Found Cross-contract Vulnerability:

In the following pages, we show our exploits of the found vulnerabilities. Note that due to ethical issues, a full list of exploits will not be opened until the developer fix the vulnerabilities.
